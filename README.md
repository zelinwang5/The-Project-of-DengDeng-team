# The-Project-of-DengDeng-team
It's a repository for the cuhacking 2021.

Hello hackers, this is DengDeng team. We are two freshmen who have just arrived to Canada and started our College life for only one month, which means we are two rookies not only as students of Carleton but also as hackers, we even unable to understand the discussion in discord because they are all in English (smile). However,maybe we don't have qualification to be called hackers, we still wanna to join in this great activity to learn, to talk, and to show you what we have. That's why we made this small form contain the using of tree traversal. (sorry about the typing problem in the file, when we find that problem, we don't have enough time to fix that, but that won't influence the running of the file)

Anyway, after hours of typing, disputing and learning while working (XDDD) we finally finish the creation of this file one hour before the deadline of submission. This form is simple, it is wrotten by C#, contain two basic parts of tree traversal and three external parts of that. The two basic parts are the insertion of keys and values, and the Four different ways to order that tree. The three external parts are finding maximum and minimum in a tree, finding key, count, floor and ceil, and the reversion of the count, and removing the minimum value or anyone with the search of keys.

Just as we said, we are two new guys to Carleton University and Cuhacking, but we don't feel fear in front of mistakes and problems, even others think 'this simple thing can't be called a program', it's fine to us because even ourselves know that rough form won't be a good one. Our purpose here is not to get the score, instead, we come here to study and to enjoy the greatest activity to every Computer Science students. That's all for that, looking forward to meeting you again in next few years cuhacking!
